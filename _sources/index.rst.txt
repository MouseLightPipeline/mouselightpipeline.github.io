Mouse Light Pipeline is a collection of services that facilitate the multi-step data processing of the several-thousand tiles per acquisition sample. The processing may occur in real-time as the data becomes available, offline after acquisition is complete, or a combination of both. Although originally designed to utilize metadata specific to the Mouse Light acquisition process, it has since been generalized to allow processing of additional input sources.
